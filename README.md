## Segmentation Code
The python scripts. There are a few similar repositories that have similar code. For example, for segmentation a 
more comprehensive code exists at: https://github.com/hoffmannjordan/Fast-Marching-Image-Segmentation
and for some wing statistics, code can be found at https://github.com/hoffmannjordan/insect-wing-venation-patterns.
All code provided has been tested in python 2.7. Python 3 should be a very minor port, mainly reformatting some print
statements.

## Analysis Code
There is a _Mathematica_ notebook that will do the analysis of the segmented files. The _Mathematica_ code always uses
a segmented csv file.
